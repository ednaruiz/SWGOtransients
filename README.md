# SWGOtransients

Small routines to do an extrapolation of HAWC sensitivity
in the parameter space of
* E [100 GeV, 10 TeV]
* zenith [0 deg, 50 deg]
* time [1 sec, 100 sec]

see Example.ipynb for an usage illustration of sensitivity.py.

*lightcurve.py* contains support functions to parse and plot
the swift-bat+xrt lightcurves of the _burst analyser_ products of
the swift detected GRBs.
